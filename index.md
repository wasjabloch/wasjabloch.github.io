I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia, investigating
continental fault zones, subduction zones and subsurface fluid processes using
seismology. My research involves the the creation of highly resloved earthquake
catalogs, earthquake characterization, receiver functions and seismic tomographies to
learn about earthquake and Earth's interior sturcture.

I am previliged to live and work on the traditional, ancestral, unceded territories of
the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm Musqueam.
