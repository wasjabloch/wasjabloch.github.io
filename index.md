I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia, investigating
continental fault zones and subduction zones using seismology. My research involves the
the creation of highly resloved earthquake catalogs, characterization of individual
earthquakes, and investigation of the seismic waveform to learn about Earth's interior
sturcture.

I am previliged to live and work on the traditional, ancestral, unceded territories of
the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) peoples.
