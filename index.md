I am a postdoctoral researcher at GFZ, GeoForschungszentrum Potsdam, investigating fault
zones, subduction zones and subsurface fluid processes using seismology. My research
involves detecting and locating earthquakes, computing earthquake magnitudes,
determining fault plane solutions and moment tensors, receiver function processing,
calculation of seismic tomographies and software development to learn about earthquakes
and Earth's interior structure.
