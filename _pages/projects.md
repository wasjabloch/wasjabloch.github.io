## Subducting Water

I use recevier functions to estimate the amount of water that subducts into the Earth
along its convergent plate boundaries. This involves automated processing of decades of
seismogrmas and inversion of the seismic waveform for anisotropic elastic subsurface
properties.

## Fault Interaction

I built high-resolution seismic event and focal mechanism catalogs from dense temporary
local seismic networks to illuminate the suite of continental fault zones that got
activated during an earhquake sequence that struck the Pamir Plateau of Central Asia
between 2015 and 2017. This research allowed for the identification of tectonically
active structures and the interpretation of earthquake occurrence in a refined
seismotectonic context.

Charcterzation of earthquakes and seismicity and seismic tomography helps
