# Methods
I create and work intensely with big-data seismic events catalogs and investigate the
seismic waveform to determine subsurface structures and earthquake source
characteristics. My work builds on top of the scientific open-source software
eco-system, predominantly in the *Python* programming language. I am a strong believer
in reproducible research and both employ and share open data and open code.

## Earthquake Characterization
I characterize earthquakes in terms of their location, origin time, magnitude and focal
mechanism. The resulting earthquake catalogs form the basis for the identification of
seismically active structures in the area in question and their interpretation in
a tectonic context. The catalogs can be evaluated with statistical or machine learning
methods to recognize spatial and temporal patterns of earthquake occurrence and
re-occurrence. From the focal mechanisms, I compute the tectonic stress tensor.


## Receiver Funcitons
I compute receiver functions form global earthquake seismograms observed at single
seismic stations. They hold information about subsurface interfaces and the elastic
properties of the units in between. I develop
forward and inverse computational methods to retrieve this information using Bayesian
statistics.

## Seismic Tomography
I compute 3-dimensional images of the subsurface elastic wave speed structure from the
arrival times of seismic waves at dense seismic networks. These images can be
interpreted in terms of subsurface structure and properties. Combined with the
earthquake distribution, they facilitate complex interpretations of tectonic processes.

## Petrophysical Modelling
I interpret the elastic properties derived from the receiver functions and seismic
tomography in terms of rock types using petrophysical models. These models are based on
published laboratory measurements of natural and synthetic rock samples and honor
effects of elastic anisotropy, fluid-filled pore-space and changes of elastic properties
with pressure and temperature.
